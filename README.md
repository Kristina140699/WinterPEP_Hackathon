This is a Hackathon project for Competitive Coding training by the university
Problem Statement
"Pathfinding Visualizer:

Create a web-based application that allows users to visualize and interact with various pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, or Breadth-First Search. Users can draw obstacles on a grid, set start and end points, and observe how different algorithms find the shortest path for any INPUT data. This project involves implementing graph data structures, different pathfinding algorithms, and a user-friendly interface."
